Pertelian

This is a C# port of the C library for controlling Pertelian X2040 LCD display
(http://www.pertelian.com/).

Work in progress. I have not had time to finish this.
Initially I wanted to use this lib for displaying email count
on my Linux box at work (I don't want to trust my password to 3rd party libs).
Needs testing.
